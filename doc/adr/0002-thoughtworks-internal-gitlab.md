# 2. Thoughtworks internal gitlab

Date: 06/07/2016

## Status

Superceded by [15. Use github for source hosting](0015-use-github-for-source-hosting.md)

## Context

We need a shared repository for version control and to store our source files securely.

## Decision

We will use ThoughtWorks Gitlab to host our repository because it provides secure and private internal access. It is also free.

## Consequences

As the repository can only be accessed on ThoughtWorks network, it is not open-source and cannot receive public contribution/feedback.
