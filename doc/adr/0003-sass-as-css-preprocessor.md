# 3. sass as css preprocessor

Date: 06/07/2016

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need a css preprocessor to speed up development time and reduce duplicate code.

## Decision

We chose Sass over Less because:
* the team has more experience with Sass than Less
* sass lets you write re-usable methods and use logic statements in a more efficient way than Less
* it is more widely used and has good supporting documentation

## Consequences

None at this stage.
