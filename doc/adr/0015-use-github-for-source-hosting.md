# 15. Use github for source hosting

Date: 06/09/2016

## Status

Accepted

Supercedes [2. Thoughtworks internal gitlab](0002-thoughtworks-internal-gitlab.md)

## Context

As active development of the project is coming to a close, the source code needs to be shared with various stakeholders and interested parties.

The source code is now published under an open source licence (Apache 2). The private git host we currently use is not publicly available.

## Decision

We will publish and host the source code of the application on github.com.

## Consequences

The code will be public for all to see.
