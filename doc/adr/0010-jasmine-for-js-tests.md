# 10. Jasmine for JS Test

Date: 22/08/2016

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to write tests for our javascript as they are getting more and more complicated

## Decision

Jasmine JS is a BDD (Behaviour Driven Development) testing framework so it encourages TDD. It is very commonly used and

the documentation for it is very good.

## Consequences

We will be using Jasmine to test our existing javascript.
