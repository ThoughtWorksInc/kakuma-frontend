# 6. Ruby

Date: 07/07/2016

## Status

Accepted

## Context

For chosing a language, we needed to consider suitability, experience of the team, and maintainability after the team has rolled off.

For team experience, Andrew only has significant Java/C#, but both of these were deemed too heavy, and Lucy and Chris' Java experience is not sufficient to make it a compelling choice in light of their complexity.

Lucy has Ruby experience, and Chris and Andrew are happy/keen to learn it.

For suitability we appealed to expertise, Laura P said she would chose Ruby.

For maintainability, ruby is pretty popular, and still ranks as one of the top languages on Github. Impala (the french web-agency previously engaged by Emmy and Lieven) are also a Ruby shop.

## Decision

We're going with Ruby.

## Consequences

We do need to chose a web framework.
We're now keen to use ruby exclusively for build and dev time activities, for example we don't really want to need Node for Jade.
Andrew and Chris have to learn Ruby
