# 5. heroku as hosting and deployment platform

Date: 06/07/2016

## Status

Proposed

## Context

We need a hosting and deployment platform to showcase the web application.

## Decision

We chose Heroku because:
* it is free and easy to set up
* can be changed later

## Consequences

* We did not use S3 because it costs money
* We did not use Github pages as we are currently not using Github but in the future, we may use github.
